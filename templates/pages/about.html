            As part of our revenue model, Technikod offers subscriptions to our

        </div>
        <div class="about-wrap">
          <p>
            Technikod generates revenue through advertising and branded content.
            It's important to note that advertisements and branded content are
            developed and sold separately from Technikod's categories. All
            branded content is clearly labeled as such, and it's essential to
            understand that advertisements do not reflect the views of
            Technikod's editorial staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, the editorial team may create packages, stories, and
            newsletters sponsored by advertisers. In such cases, these pieces
            are clearly marked as "sponsored by." However, please be assured
            that editorial content produced in collaboration with sponsors is
            developed in the same rigorous manner as our standard editorial
            content and adheres to the same high editorial standards.

            In some of our blog posts and news articles, you may find affiliate
            links. When you make a purchase through these links, Technikod may
            receive a commission, without any additional cost to you as the

            to provide a positive review of a product or to include it in a
            buying guide. Our reviews remain entirely independent and unbiased.
